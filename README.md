# Graph_Partitioner_for_Distributed_system
In this project, we will implement a middleware called graph partitioner. This partitioner will include several state-of-the-art graph partitioning algorithms by which a graph can be partitioned and stored to the database array. As a result, the clients can follow the corresponding procedure to access the graph data on each partition of the graph according to different partitiong strategies. we will test against different graph partitioning algorithm to see how the distributed graph database array will perform when applying different graph partitioning algorithms.
